Paragraph
        How is each function different than eachother, and what patterns are
    noticed in the runtime results? Well, when you start with the extraLargeArray, the time it takes is higher than all the other arrays.
    The inserts(unshift) for bigger arrays takes longer to log, but for 
    appends(push), smaller arrays log slower and inserts finish faster.
